    It’s been a pleasure to work with Gideon. He is very knowledgeable in
    troubleshooting Navicare. Most of all, he is reachable and/or responds
    rapidly when I reach out to him. He also seems to value my opinion or
    suggestion. Together, we solve problems (that are within his control)
    within minutes.
</p>
<p>
    If I really had to say something negative, it would be that when the other
    entity has a problem, it is not always communicated. There have been
    occasions when we too are experiencing the same problem but the staff has
    not communicated an issue. The problem is discovered the next day when data
    is missing in reports. Since he now has “others” with him, this may not be
    within his total control.
</p>
<p>
    Sincerely,
</p>
<p>

    Shout out to Gideon who has ALWAYS been my go to guy for Navicare issues.
    He is courteous and prompt to correct any issue I may experience. Today I
    spoke with him for an issue and he remembered my name and department and
    immediately corrected my issue. Kudos….. Gideon for great service with a
    SMILE in your voice!!!!
</p>
<p>
    PS: You are the SHIZZZZZ NIT.

    For the last year, Gideon has been the <em>Power of One</em> for NaviCare
    IS support. Even with the reduction on NaviCare’s use since the
    implementation of PennChart, NaviCare continues to be used by hundreds of
    users daily at HUP, PCAM, PPMC and PAH. Gideon provides level 1, 2 and 3
    support for a range of NaviCare issues from the simple to the technically
    complex.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to NaviCare support, Gideon has never let his job description
    limit his desire to provide timely support to the end users. He has worked
    many hours outside normal work hours supporting NaviCare. He has always
    been eager to learn new skills in understanding the technical,
    “behind-the-scenes” aspects to NaviCare. The best example of this is
    learning how diagnose and troubleshoot problems with the NaviCare Gateways,
    imports, and now screen configuration.
</p>
<p>
    Gideon has provided written documentation for troubleshooting many issues
    in NaviCare, which has allowed on-call after-hours staff to be able to
    resolve complicated support issues for NaviCare.

    P.S. You are the Shiznit in my book!
